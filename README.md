Project Title:
Tamagotchi Pet App

Description: 
The `Tamagotchi` class is a virtual pet that has characteristics such as hunger, happiness, energy, and the status of being alive.  
The class covers methods for playing, sleeping, feeding, and monitoring the pet's vital signs to make sure it's still alive.   

Installation: 
Android device.
Internet connection.

Usage: 
The main function uses the pet's name that the user enters to create an instance of `Tamagotchi`.  
It then goes into a loop where the user can engage with the pet, such as choosing to play, feed and clean the pet.  
As actions are taken the pet's state such as hunger, happiness and energy will shift over time, (the pet's state is also based on the player's actions).  
This interactive experience allows the player to care for their virtual pet and see how their choices will impact the pet's well-being.
